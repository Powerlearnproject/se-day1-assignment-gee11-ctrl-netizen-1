#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is the systemic application of engineering principles, tools and methods to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involes the steps of: Design, Develpment, Testing, Deployment and maintence of software products.

IMPORTANCE OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING IN TECHNOLOGY
Scalability: Software with proper engineering can accommodate expanding user bases and data quantities.
Stability and reliability: Software systems with appropriate engineering techniques are more dependable and stable.
Security: To create secure systems that safeguard user data and privacy, good software engineering is necessary.
Efficiency: Well-designed architectures and optimized code boost productivity and use fewer resources.
Maintainability: Over time, it is simpler to update, debug, and improve engineered software.
Interoperability: Software engineering makes it possible for various technologies and systems to function together without any problems.
Innovation: It offers the starting point for creating novel technologies and uses.
Cost-effectiveness: Although they take more time at first, solid engineering techniques lower technological debt and long-term expenses.
User experience: Better user interfaces and experiences are typically offered by well-engineered software.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s
- the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
- the development of programming languages for example fotran and C


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement analysis- Involves gathering and documenting user needs and software system requirement.
Design- Creating a high kevek and detailed designs of software and user interface.
Testing- Cnducting several tests to ensure system meets quality standards and functional requirements. 
Deployment- Releasing software to users and customers.
Maintence- Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall and agile are both software development methodologies.
Waterfall methodology- This is the sequential approach to software development that involves the distinct phases for example: requirements, design, implemenation. We can say that the flow is downwards and is likened to that of a waterfall hence the name. However, waterfall approach has its own downside where it offers less flexibility for changes or feedback unlike the agile approach.

Agile Mehthodology- Is an approach that offers iterative progress which breaks down development into smaller cycles or "sprints." Each sprint delivers a working increament of the software, allowing for continuous improvement and adaptation based on feedback it also values the continous interaction with the customer or user to make sure that the software product align with their requirements.This feedback is incorporated into each sprint, leading to a more relevant and valuable product. Â  




Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
ROLES OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPER
- Writitng code and implementing software solutions
- Debugging: Identifying and fixing errors or bugs in the software.
-Collaborating: Working closely with other team members, including QA engineers and project managers, to ensure the project's success.

ROLES OF A QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER
- ensure software quality by desgning and organzing and running test plans
- ocumenting and tracking defects, providing detailed reports to the development team.
- Developing and maintaining automated test scripts to improve efficiency and coverage

ROLES OF A PROJECT MANAGER
- oversees planning, execution and delivery of software projects
- Managing stakeholder expectations, providing regular updates, and resolving conflict
- Defining project scope, goals, and timelines.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs
Provide the comprehensive  toold for writing, debugging and testing code . Example is VS Code, Eclipse, IntelliJ 

Version control systems
Provide the capability to track changes to sources code  and conduction work among team members. 
Examples are: Git, subversion and many more.



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Challenges
- Changing requirements- This might happen during the development phase and it will mmean the re-adjustment or even total scraping off of the whole documented processes and system rquirements and start on fresh grounds.
- Tight deadlines- Pressure to deliver the software product on schedule may lead to rushed development hence a compromised quality.
- Technical Debt- maybe as a result of shortcuts or suboptimal solutions. This may even impede the future development efforts and increase the maintence costs.

Strategies to overcome challenges
- Effective communication
- Implement the agile methodology that utilises the iterative and customer feedback approach.
- Prioritization of tasks
- -Regular re-assessment of project goals and timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing- testing individual components or modules of a system software.
Intergartion testing- testinmg for the interaction between the different components or subsystems.
System testing- testing entire software system as whole.
Acceptance testing- testing software against user requirements to ensure it meets users needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering- crafting questions  or statements to get the best possible and relevant responses from AI or Largescale language Models (LLMs)

Importance: 
 - Well-written prompts improve the accuracy with which AI models interpret human intent, producing more pertinent and understandable results.
 - By directing AI models to concentrate on specific facets of a subject, specific prompts might produce outputs that are more precise and educational.
 - You may utilize prompt engineering to help AI models come up with inventive and creative stuff, such short stories, poetry, or bits of code.
 - Good prompts can save time and effort by lowering the number of iterations required to achieve the desired result.
 - AI models become more effective and practical tools when users may adapt them to meet their own requirements and preferences thanks to prompt engineering.



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

vague prompt: "Tell me about AI."
improved : "Explain the concept of artificial intelligence in simple terms, focusing on its applications in healthcare."

Why the improved prompt is more effective:

It is clear- the improved prompt directly asks for a specific explanation, avoiding ambiguity.
It is specific- it narrows down the focus to healthcare applications, ensuring a more relevant and targeted response.
It is concise- the improved prompt is shorter and to the point, making it easier for the AI to understand and respond to.
